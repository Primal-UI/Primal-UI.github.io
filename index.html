<a id="design-approach" class="anchor" href="#design-approach" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Design Approach</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qVEXJF1SYD4">Primal UI</a> is designed to be <strong>as minimal as possible, while being comprehensive</strong>.  Concretely, the idea is to show all information that may reasonably affect a player's decisions in combat, and nothing above that.  I don't believe a general interface created for different classes, specializations and roles can follow this approach, so I decided to only support one.</p>

<p>UI elements are generally designed and positioned for maximum symmetry and consistence.  Asymmetry is used deliberately to distinguish them or indicate deviations from the most natural, inconsequential situation a player could be in (i.e. out of combat, everyone at full health, etc.).</p>

<h2>
<a id="disclaimer" class="anchor" href="#disclaimer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disclaimer</h2>

<ul>
<li>If you're planning to use this UI for a class and specialization other than Feral: don't bother unless you are prepared to spend significant effort adapting it.</li>
<li>I don't PvE.  Requirements for a PvE UI might not be fully met out of the box.  Missing features shouldn't be too hard to add, though.</li>
<li>I did not try to make this interface intuitive, but rather to make it as efficient as possible once a user is familiar with it.  For example, there are no action bars for clicking abilities: you should create and memorize keybindings for all of them.</li>
</ul>

<a id="installation" class="anchor" href="#installation" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Installation</h2>

<p>First, you should probably <strong>backup your current UI</strong>.</p>

<ul>
<li>Download the Primal UI archive: <a href="TODO">TODO</a>.</li>
<li>Replace these folders in your game directory with the ones from the archive: Fonts/, Interface/ and WTF/.</li>
<li>Rename WTF\Account\YOURACCOUNT.</li>
<li>Launch the game, enable the PrimalCore AddOn and log in.</li>
<li>Open the Game Menu and click on "Primal UI" and follow the instructions.  Reload your UI after clicking "Enable AddOns" and again after clicking "Setup AddOns".</li>
<li>The installer from the last step is incomplete. You'll have to switch some profiles manually.  Check that all addons are using the correct profile and reload.</li>
</ul>

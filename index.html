<p>Primal UI is designed to be <strong>as minimal as possible, but not more</strong>.  More concretely, the idea is to show all information that may reasonably affect a player's decisions in combat, and nothing above that.  I don't believe an interface created for different classes, specializations and roles can follow this approach, so I decided to only support one.</p>

<a id="disclaimer" class="anchor" href="#disclaimer" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Disclaimer</h3>

<ul>
<li>If you're planning to use this UI for a class and specialization other than Feral: don't bother unless you are prepared to spend significant effort adapting this UI</li>
<li>I did not try to make this interface intuitive, but rather to make it as efficient as possible once a user is familiar with it.  For example, there are no action bars for clicking abilities: you are expected to create and memorize keybindings for all your abilities.</li>
<li>I don't PvE.  Requirements for a PvE UI might not be met.</li>
</ul>

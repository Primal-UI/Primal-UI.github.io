{"name":"Primal UI","tagline":"World of Warcraft Interface for Feral Druids","body":"### Design Approach\r\nPrimal UI is designed to be **as minimal as possible, but not more**.  Concretely, the idea is to show all information that may reasonably affect a player's decisions in combat, and nothing above that.  I don't believe an interface created for different classes, specializations and roles can follow this approach, so I decided to only support one.\r\n\r\nUI elements are generally designed and positioned for maximum symmetry and consistence.  Asymmetry is used deliberately to distinguish them or indicate deviations from the most natural, inconsequential situation a player could be in (i.e. out of combat, everyone at full health, etc.).\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n* If you're planning to use this UI for a class and specialization other than Feral: don't bother unless you are prepared to spend significant effort adapting it.\r\n* I don't PvE.  Requirements for a PvE UI might not be met.\r\n* I did not try to make this interface intuitive, but rather to make it as efficient as possible once a user is familiar with it.  For example, there are no action bars for clicking abilities: you should create and memorize keybindings for all of them.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\n1. TODO.\r\n2. TODO.\r\n3. TODO.\r\n4. TODO.\r\n5. TODO.\r\n6. TODO.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

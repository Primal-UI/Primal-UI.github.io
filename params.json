{"name":"Primal UI","tagline":"World of Warcraft Interface for Feral Druids","body":"## Design Approach\r\nPrimal UI is designed to be **as minimal as possible, while being comprehensive**.  Concretely, the idea is to show all information that may reasonably affect a player's decisions in combat, and nothing above that.  I don't believe a general interface created for different classes, specializations and roles can follow this approach, so I decided to only support one.\r\n\r\nUI elements are generally designed and positioned for maximum symmetry and consistence.  Asymmetry is used deliberately to distinguish them or indicate deviations from the most natural, inconsequential situation a player could be in (i.e. out of combat, everyone at full health, etc.).\r\n\r\n## Disclaimer\r\n* If you're planning to use this UI for a class and specialization other than Feral: don't bother unless you are prepared to spend significant effort adapting it.\r\n* I don't PvE.  Requirements for a PvE UI might not be fully met out of the box.  Missing features shouldn't be too hard to add, though.\r\n* I did not try to make this interface intuitive, but rather to make it as efficient as possible once a user is familiar with it.  For example, there are no action bars for clicking abilities: you should create and memorize keybindings for all of them.\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n1. TODO: download link.\r\n2. **Backup your current UI.**\r\n3. Remove these folders from your game directory: TODO.\r\n4. Extract the Primal UI archive into your game directory.\r\n5. TODO: instructions for renaming folders.\r\n6. Launch the game, enable the PrimalCore addon and log in.\r\n7. Open the Game Menu and click on \"Primal UI\".\r\n8. TODO: Chat?  CVars? \r\n9. Enable all addons and reload.\r\n10. You'll have to switch some profiles manually.  Check that all addons are using the correct profile and reload.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!

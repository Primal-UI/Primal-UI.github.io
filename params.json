{"name":"Primal UI","tagline":"World of Warcraft Interface for Feral Druids","body":"### Design Approach\r\nPrimal UI is designed to be **as minimal as possible, but not more**.  More concretely, the idea is to show all information that may reasonably affect a player's decisions in combat, and nothing above that.  I don't believe an interface created for different classes, specializations and roles can follow this approach, so I decided to only support one.\r\n\r\n### Disclaimer\r\n* If you're planning to use this UI for a class and specialization other than Feral: don't bother unless you are prepared to spend significant effort adapting this UI\r\n* I did not try to make this interface intuitive, but rather to make it as efficient as possible once a user is familiar with it.  For example, there are no action bars for clicking abilities: you are expected to create and memorize keybindings for all your abilities.\r\n* I don't PvE.  Requirements for a PvE UI might not be met.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nTODO.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
